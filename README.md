# Weather App Using API Integration

## Overview  
This project is a lightweight web application that fetches real-time weather data from a public weather API and displays key metrics (temperature, humidity, and weather conditions) in a clean, responsive user interface. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and styled with the Salesforce Lightning Design System (SLDS) to showcase client–server API integration and modern UI design.

## Features  
- Retrieve current weather information (temperature, humidity, condition) for a given city.  
- Responsive and accessible user interface styled with SLDS.  
- Error handling for invalid city input or failed API requests.  
- Clean code structure enabling easy extension of features.

## Usage Example  
- Input: `Hyderabad`  
- Output might show:  
  - Temperature: `28 °C`  
  - Humidity: `65%`  
  - Condition: `Clear sky`

## Future Enhancements  
- Incorporate additional weather metrics (e.g., wind speed, pressure, visibility).  
- Enable automatic location detection using the Geolocation API.  
- Cache recent searches and implement a search history in the UI.  
- Add settings for preferred units (Celsius/Fahrenheit).  
- Create background visuals that change based on weather condition for better UX.
